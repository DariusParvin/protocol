# UMA Protocol Spec

This is the source of truth protocol definition for UMA. All proposed spec changes should be sent as PRs to this repo. Note that UMA is an extension of LNURL. If your proposal is also applicable to LNURL, the preference should be to [propose a new LUD](https://github.com/lnurl/luds).

This repo is organized as a set of individual documents describing a single message or component of the protocol.
