# UMAD-03: LNURLP Request

The first request in the UMA protocol is the LNURLP request, which aligns with LNURL-PAY ([LUD-06](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md)), but with a few added query parameters.

If `$alice@vasp1.com` is paying `$bob@vasp2.com`, the request looks like:

```http
GET https://vasp2.com/.well-known/lnurlp/$bob?umaVersion=1.0&nonce=1234&vaspDomain=vasp1.com&signature=abcd&isSubjectToTravelRule=true&timestamp=12345678
```

- `umaVersion` **(string)**: is the UMA protocol version supported by VASP1. See the [versioning UMAD](/umad-08-versioning.md).
- `vaspDomain` **(string)**: is the domain name of the sending vasp. This will be used when validating the signature as per [UMAD-02](/umad-02-keys-and-authentication.md).
- `isSubjectToTravelRule` **(bool)**: indicates vasp1 is a financial institution that is subject to the Travel Rule.
- `nonce` **(string)**: is a random unique string generated by the SDK that is used to prevent replay attacks.
- `timestamp` **(long)**: is the unix timestamp in seconds (number of seconds since epoch).
- `signature` **(string)**: is vasp1's signature over `hash("$bob@vasp2.com" + nonce + timestamp)`. Signatures are always hex-encoded strings for UMA. Details on signatures, keys, and how to generate them can be found in [UMAD-02: Keys and Authentication](/umad-02-keys-and-authentication.md).
